            A hospital is a health-care facility that provides
            specialized medical and nursing services as well as
            medical equipment to patients. The most well-known type
            of hospital is the general hospital, which usually features
            an emergency room to address urgent health issues such as fire
            and accident victims, as well as acute illness. A district hospital
            is usually the region's primary health-care facility, with a large number
            of intensive-care beds and additional beds for patients who require long-term
            care. Trauma centers, rehabilitation hospitals, children's hospitals, seniors'
            (geriatric) hospitals, and hospitals for dealing with specific medical needs
            such as psychiatric treatment are all examples of specialized hospitals.
